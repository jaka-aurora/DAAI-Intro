# Introduction to Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my work from the Introduction to Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (DAAI) course at JAMK University of Applied Sciences. It includes multiple Jupyter notebooks that explore fundamental concepts in data analysis and introductory AI techniques using Python. The exercises demonstrate basic data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and simple model implementation skills.

## Skills Covered

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization with Python libraries
- Basic machine learning concepts  

## Contents

**Exercises** — A set of Jupyter notebooks with hands-on tasks exploring data analysis and AI topics  
- _ex01-python-fundamentals-1_ - Introduction to Python basics, including variables, control flow, functions, and basic data structures.  
- _ex02-python-fundamentals-2_ - Continued Python fundamentals with more advanced examples and practical problem-solving tasks.  
- _ex03-data-sources_ - Working with different data sources, including loading data from files and inspecting raw datasets.  
- _ex04-pandas-1_ - Introduction to data manipulation using pandas: DataFrames, indexing, filtering, and basic operations.  
- _ex05-pandas-2_ - More advanced pandas usage, including data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation techniques.  
- _ex06-numpy_ - Numerical computing with NumPy, focusing on arrays, vectorized operations, and basic numerical analysis.  
- _ex07-data-visualization_ - Data visualization using Python libraries, creating plots and charts to explore and communicate insights.  
- _ex08-K-means-clustering_ - Unsupervised learning example using K-means clustering to identify patterns and groupings in data.  
- _ex09-KNN_ - Supervised learning example using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks.  
- _ex10-Decision-tree_ - Supervised learning using decision trees, including model training, prediction, and basic evaluation.  

**README.md** — This overview and usage instructions  
**requirements.txt** - Contains libraries used in the notebooks

> Each notebook contains commented code, explanations in Markdown, and visual output (plots, charts) where applicable.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 

## How to run notebooks

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```  
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Start Jupyter Notebook

> Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently unless stated otherwise.
